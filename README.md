# D<sup>2</sup><sub>min</sub>

Python code to calculate the D<sup>2</sup><sub>min</sub> between an initial and final state of particles; a measure of how non-affine the transformation is, as originally described
in Falk & Langer (1998).

Modifications from [upstream repo](https://github.com/Binxu-Stack/D2min) include more documentation, change of notation,
and change from bond-focused calculation to center-focused calculation (see code for more details).
Since this code is intended for use within other projects, CLI access has been removed.

Examples
--------

See [test](https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/D2min/tree/master/test) folder in repository for example usage.
